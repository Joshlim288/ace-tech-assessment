# ace-tech-assessment
We are the Champions

Application to track scores and positions of teams in a football tournament

# Assumptions made
- Assuming the application is run in a secure private network and authentication is not required, anyone can access and enter/clear data
- Was designed purely for use on a desktop web browser

# Pre-requisites to run application
Currently, only Docker is required to be installed.

# Running the application

## Local run
1. Navigate to `ACE` directory and run `Docker compose up`
2. Webapp can then be accessed at `localhost:8080`

Do note that if you are on windows, you should run with powershell instead of command prompt.
